# herbDB
A searchable database for herbs used in traditional medicine.

I have started making traditional sodas, and plan to make herbal sodas based on traditional herbal remedies for ailments such as upset stomachs, headaches, etc.  This project is intended to be a searchable database in which I can search for herbs with certain properties or flavor profiles.  The information contained within is based off of The Way of Herbs by Michael Tierra (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345266.The_Way_of_Herbs) and should be considered a transformative work.

This database is for reference only and is not intended to offer any medical advice.  Consult a licensed medical proffessional should be consulted before starting any herbal supplements.
